# Intergalactic Trading Network

## Description

Backend System for an Intergalactic Trading Network. This system will handle trade transactions, manage space cargo, and track space station inventory. The system handles high throughput data and provides real-time updates on trade activities across multiple planets and space stations.

## Technologies in use

- Node.js: Using Node.js runtime environment for server-side scripting.

- Express.js: Using Express.js for building the RESTful API. I will be using express.js because it is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It makes building RESTful APIs easier and faster.

- MongoDB: Using MongoDB as the database because it is a NoSQL database and it is easy to scale and manage. It is great with handling high volume data and provides real-time features.

- Redis: Using Redis as a caching layer to store frequently accessed data. Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
